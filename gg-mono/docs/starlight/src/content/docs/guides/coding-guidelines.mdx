Lean towards kebab case for most file names. If you see an exception such as the 'gg_native' folder its because the react native init system doesn't except kebab case.

Most coding conventions are applied by the Biome linter and formatter. You can find the 'biome.json' config file in the root of the repo.

import FileTree from '../../../components/file-tree.astro';

<FileTree>
  - .github/
  - .vscode/
  - gg-mono/
  - native_gg/
  - .gitignore
  - **biome.json**
