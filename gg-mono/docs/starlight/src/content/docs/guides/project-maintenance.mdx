### .github/workflows/main.yml

import FileTree from '../../../components/file-tree.astro';

<FileTree>
 - .github/
    - workflows/
      - **main.yml**
    - dependabot.yml

</FileTree>

The 'main.yml' github action is triggered on every push to the repo. It builds the project and conditionally
runs the related Sonarqube scans depending on if any files have changed. See more here for how that works [Source helper](https://how.wtf/run-workflow-step-or-job-based-on-file-changes-github-actions.html).


### CI secrets

Dependabot doesn't get access to repo secrets to be able to deploy the various web projects after a dependency changes. These secrets are duplicated [here](https://github.com/NigelBreslaw/guardian-ghost/settings/secrets/dependabot).

### Syncpack

[Syncpack](https://jamiemason.github.io/syncpack/) is an NPM tool to help keep a monorepo consistent. It is able to scan all the package.json files, make them consistent, sort items alphabetically and spot dependencies where one project is using a different version to another. 

Occasionally run the 'syncpack' script in the root package.json to keep things consistent. However dependency consistency is enforced via dependabot.
