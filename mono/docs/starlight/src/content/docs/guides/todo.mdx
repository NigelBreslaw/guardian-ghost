I prefer to keep the github issues as clean as possible. For certain types of todo, 
such as those where I am waiting on a new feature with no clear date I will store them here.


- [ ] When possible move the react-native project into the PNPM workspaces. It's a future plan of Expo and react-native.
- [ ] Github action to check documentation for dead links. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/examples/using-the-github-cli-on-a-runner).
- [ ] Android signing action is outdated and no longer [maintained](https://github.com/r0adkll/sign-android-release).
- [ ] Trial a remote gradle cache.
- [ ] Trial a shared ccache, scache?
- [ ] Look at adding [Codspeed](https://codspeed.io/blog) for CI based benchmarking
- [ ] Dev helper bash script: Create a bash script that checks you have the right version of various tools such as git, xcode, etc and clones and sets everything up for you.
