I prefer to keep the github issues as clean as possible. For certain types of todo, 
such as those where I am waiting on a new feature with no clear date I will store them here.

- [ ] When Biome [supports](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-re-export-all) it, add a rule to enforce this. Also update
the coding guide page that has this todo on it.
- [ ] When possible move the react-native project into the PNPM workspaces. It's a future plan of Expo and react-native.
- [ ] Github action to check documentation for dead links. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/examples/using-the-github-cli-on-a-runner).
- [ ] Android signing action is outdated and no longer [maintained](https://github.com/r0adkll/sign-android-release).
- [ ] Look into an nginx reverse proxy for turbo repo with ssh key so https can be used. Seems oracle support updating the ssl themselves, but you still need to generate your own cert first.
- [ ] Try out Graphite stacked diffs?
- [ ] Trial a remote gradle cache.
- [ ] Trial a local ccache.
- [ ] Trial a shared ccache, scache?
- [ ] Look at adding [Codspeed](https://codspeed.io/blog) for CI based benchmarking
