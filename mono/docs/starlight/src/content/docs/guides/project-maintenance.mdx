### .github/workflows/main.yml

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


<FileTree>
 - .github/
    - workflows/
      - **main.yml**
    - dependabot.yml

</FileTree>

The 'main.yml' github action is triggered on every push to the repo. See more here for how that works [Source helper](https://how.wtf/run-workflow-step-or-job-based-on-file-changes-github-actions.html).

### Dependabot

Dependabot runs every workday in the morning. It checks for any dependency updates and creates a PR if it finds any. It also checks for any security vulnerabilities and creates a PR if it finds any.

Updates are then manually reviewed and merged in the following order:

1. Security updates (Any change to Dependabot or CodeQL github-actions counts as a security update).
2. Breaking updates.
3. Non-breaking 'github-actions' updates.
4. Non-breaking 'dependency' updates.
5. Non-breaking 'devDependency' updates.

If after merging a PR a Dependabot PR has a conflict, Dependabot will automatically update the PR with the latest changes and rebase it. This can take a few minutes.
To see the progress of these updates they can be found [here](https://github.com/NigelBreslaw/guardian-ghost/network/updates).


### CI secrets

Dependabot doesn't get access to repo secrets to be able to deploy the various web projects after a dependency changes. These secrets are duplicated [here](https://github.com/NigelBreslaw/guardian-ghost/settings/secrets/dependabot).


### Tokens and Certificates

Most project certificates automatically renew themselves. However the cloudflare tokens to deploy need updating every 90 days. On a solo project like this it isn't really necessary, but just a good habit to keep.
