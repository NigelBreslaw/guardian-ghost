Stat labels now use full english text e.g. "Aim Assistance" instead of "AimAssistance".
The details bottom sheet should now behave a bit better, but it's not perfect.
You can now pan down to dismiss it. But if you have scrolled some content then you have
to pan twice. Once to scroll to the top and again to dismiss the bottom sheet.
The transfer buttons will no longer fire if you tap and scroll.
